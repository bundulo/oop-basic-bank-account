/* Create a new class for a bank account

THIS IS JUST SOME BASIC STUFF TO PRACTICE SETTERS, GETTERS, AND HOW YOU CALL CLASSES

by Bence


Create fields for the account number, balance, costumer name, email and phone number.

Create getters and setters for each field
Create two additional methods
1. To allow the costumer to deposit funds(this should increment the balance field).
2. To allow the costumer to withdraw funds. This should deduct from the balance field,
but not allow the withdrawal to complete if their are insufficient funds.

You will want to create various code in the Main class (the one created by IntelliJ) to confirm your code is working.

Add some Sout's in the two methods above as well.
